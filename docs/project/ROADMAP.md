# Roadmap

Open work only.  Closed and parked item history is archived in
[`docs/history/ROADMAP-CLOSED.md`](../history/ROADMAP-CLOSED.md).  Each open
item states the evidence that would close it.

Current focus: **item 9** (peripherals).  The audio goal is closed (reports 214
and 215: headphones and both speakers); the next items are the diagnostics
cleanup and the **reopened WL1283**, with the reference-first method
(DECISIONS §61).  Item 7 (packaging) is untouched; item 8 (BB10) is parked by
the operator.

## 7. Packaging (postmarketOS-style)

The intended end state: a reproducible artefact that builds the kernel from the
patch + config, produces the chainloader image, and installs onto the device —
the shape postmarketOS uses (a device package + a kernel package + an installer).
Nothing about tooling, licence or distribution has been decided
(`DECISIONS.md` §Open policy decisions); this item records the target, not a plan.

**Closes when:** a clean checkout plus documented host prerequisites reproduces
the image byte-for-byte (same CRC) and installs it on a unit without manual
steps.

## 8. A BB10 image on the PlayBook — **PARKED (operator, session 25)**

The full analysis and the built set are in
[`docs/parked/BB10-PORT.md`](../parked/BB10-PORT.md) and
[`docs/parked/BB10-IMAGE-GUIDE.md`](../parked/BB10-IMAGE-GUIDE.md); the
session-by-session record is in
[`docs/history/ROADMAP-CLOSED.md`](../history/ROADMAP-CLOSED.md).  Reopen only
with the operator.

## 9. The device's own sensors and peripherals — **active**

**Goal.**  Bring up the board's sensors and peripherals under Linux before any
`hd3` repurpose.  Report 176 is the inventory and the bus map.

**Done.**  I²C4 motion sensors (BMA150/HMC5883L/MPU3050), TMP103, BQ27541,
FAN5702 and CM3217; the Munin touch is calibrated and has its GPIO2_3 edge IRQ
(report 198); the ISL9519 charger and the 58.6 s WDT2 policy are in the
known-good image; **the WM8994 audio plays stereo at 48 kHz on headphones and
both speakers** (sessions 46/47, reports 214/215 — the codec is on McBSP3, the
card is two ASoC links, the ABE detour is closed, and the speakers are the
codec's line outputs with `spk` active-low and GPIO1_15 as the `audio_boost`
enable; history in
[`docs/history/ROADMAP-CLOSED.md`](../history/ROADMAP-CLOSED.md)).

**Open.**

* **The WM8994 audio has two follow-ups.**  (a) **Retire the `pcm:`/`live N:`
  diagnostics** in the machine driver and `omap-mcbsp` and re-verify headphones
  and speakers (module-only, region-1 flash; then re-export the patch).  (b) The
  optional **MCLK1 probe** is trap 165 — the working design does not need it.
  The `audio_boost` net (GPIO1_15) is confirmed by behaviour but not by a
  schematic.  Closes when the diagnostics are out, the patch is re-exported and
  the tone is heard on both outputs.

* **The minimal 1917 oracle is built and has been used** (session 43/44, reports
  207/208/209).  A debloated 2.1.0.1917 IFS+RCFS — services reduced to
  `filesystem pps random pty net powerman phyctrl usbmgr rimusb`, GUI/app/font/
  browser/DRM subtrees pruned (live `/base` 90.4 MiB) — boots in ~30 s with
  `qconn` on `169.254.0.1:9090` and root `sshd`; built by
  `tools/build_minimal_qnx.py`.  **It settled the MCLK1 model:** AUXCLK1 IS the
  codec's MCLK1 (gate off + codec reset + FLL power-up → no lock; restore →
  lock), and on Linux MCLK1 is measurably **absent** with identical
  AUXCLK1/pad/stream-time FLL file (codec freeze detector, validated on the
  reference).  **The power-domain/CM comparison is done and negative** (report
  209): every power *state* matches, the only difference is the
  `LASTPOWERSTATEENTERED` debug latch, and forcing Linux's CM policies on the
  working oracle leaves MCLK1 present (report 209).  **ABE path fixed:**
  `CM_ABE_PLL_REF_CLKSEL` is SYS_CLK with DPLL_ABE locked at 98.304 MHz.  **The
  reference's codec-GPIO init is implemented** (report 211): a boot-on
  `audio-ldo` on GPIO4_31 pulsed 100 ms at probe, spk high, hp input.  It does
  **not** restore MCLK1 (`FLL1 NOT locked`) but it fixes the WM8994 probe (-121
  without it).  **Session 47** used the oracle again for the speaker:
  `Headphone Select` = false routes it to the line outputs and the speaker
  sounds, which is how the missing board lines were found (report 215).
* **WL1283 — REOPENED (operator, session-47 close).**  The session-36
  "software surface exhausted" verdict is withdrawn.  The 1917-truth minimal
  host still fails CMD5 (report 196) with pads/WL_EN/IRQ/rails matching QNX, so
  the next evidence is the **reference's own driver behaviour**: RE
  `devnp-ti1283.so`, `devc-seromap-winbt`, `devpm-omap4.so`,
  `hwio-config-winchester.so` and the powerman preset (subagents, static), then
  RUN `devnp-ti1283` on the minimal oracle with its own controls and watch the
  SDIO bring-up, then implement in the driver/DTS — the method that solved the
  speaker (report 215, DECISIONS §60/§61).  Do not re-run traps 116–137
  unchanged; an overlapping test must state what differs.  The WLAN
  calibration/NVS is extracted from QNX `hd5` (report 197) for the
  post-enumeration `wl12xx` path.  **Closes when** the chip enumerates under
  Linux (CMD5 + `attach_sdio yes`) and wl12xx probes with the hd5 NVS.
* **Touch.**  Done; the remaining nicety is driving power/reset
  (GPIO1_14 / GPIO4_8) for cold boots — a warm reset keeps the controller up
  (session 42).

## Out of scope for now

SGX/GPU, IVA-HD, camera and the secure-world (TrustZone) path are all disabled
or untouched in the board DTS.  They are not blocked on the panel.  Audio,
touch, the sensors and WiFi/BT/GPS are **no longer out of scope**: they are
item 9 (report 176).

## Working rules that apply to every item

* One variable per boot; never mix a timing experiment with a structural change.
* `fb <rrggbb>` before judging the panel; `kmsg` before theorising.
* Read `BOOTCTR_FCTRY` as a health check; the booted OS tops it up (Linux
  `/init`, TabletOS `startup.sh`).  Leave the unit on the image the operator
  wants; no restore is required.
* **Everything that writes** — RPMB, NVRAM, the eMMC, the media region, the panel
  chain — is governed by `SAFETY.md`.  Short version: writable eMMC for **our
  own** data is allowed (session 18); NVRAM and the MCT are never written; RPMB
  is the **operator's** `0x32` top-up only (an agent never writes it); never
  `SYS_RST`, never `VAUX1`.
* **Look up every external fact; do not trust recalled knowledge.**  The
  assistant's built-in knowledge is frozen at its training date and this project
  spans months of upstream movement: kernel versions, pmaports package contents,
  `arch=` lists and driver internals all drift.  On 2026-11-07 a session
  asserted that `7.3.3` "doesn't match the 6.x series" and was wrong —
  `kernel.org/releases.json` showed 7.3.3 as the current *stable*, with mainline
  at 7.4-rc1.  **Fetch the authoritative source** (`kernel.org/releases.json`,
  the actual pmaports `APKBUILD`, the tree you are about to build) and cite it,
  rather than reasoning from memory.  The same rule applies to register maps:
  prefer a live read or the local TRM over recollection.
